## Project Title

Lab-synth

## Motivation

Wanted to develop an AR game, with a basic concept I've seen. Many VR beginner guides showcase creating a FPS maze, and I think translating that experience to a 3rd person mobile game would be a fun challenge. Also seeing Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay has me in a cyberpunk mood, so the AR maze is a future toy concept.

## Screenshots
